Even with challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the team \\nwas able to work virtually and deliver the results as planned.\\nCENIBRA simplified its processes and increased customer service levels by adopting 320 \\nSAP Fiori® apps and mobile technology. Processes such as maintenance, finance, and \\nlogistics have benefited from the new technology, with the focus changed from manual \\nwork to a better evaluation of business scenarios and streamlined decision-making.\\nEnabling Next-Level Productivity by Simplifying \\nand Integrating Processes\\nProcesses with \\nSAP Fiori apps\\nFaster generation of \\nthe maintenance plan, \\nbenefiting several \\ncapital-intensive \\nprocesses\\n99%\\n“Simplification, increased performance of \\nbusiness processes, and preparation for the \\nnext steps of the transformation were the main \\nneeds of the business, but we also sought to \\nimprove the user experience.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
